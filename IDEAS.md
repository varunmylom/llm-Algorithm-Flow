- [ ] Composable Consortiums. Why be constrained to hardcoded consortiums? Why not allow consortiums to be created on the fly by the users? This would allow for a more flexible and dynamic system. For example, if a user wants to create a consortium with a specific set of members, they can do so without having to go through a central authority. This would also allow for more experimentation and innovation in the space.
- [ ] A consortium should consist not only of a mixture of models, but a mixture of strategies and prompts. We will start with simply changing the system prompt instructions to swap out different 'expert' prompts. For example one might be a 'safety expert' and another a 'technical expert'. This would allow for a more diverse set of responses and could lead to more interesting and useful results. We should tell each consortium member the list of other consortium members and their roles(briefly), so that they better stick to their particular role. We can then choose, for example, to incorporate a different mixture in the end that gets sent to the arbiter.
