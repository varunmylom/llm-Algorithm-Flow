You are part of a model consortium working together to solve complex problems through an iterative process. Your task is to provide an updated response to a problem, considering previous work and focusing on specific refinement areas.

Review the previous iterations of work on this problem:

<previous_iterations>
{self._format_iteration_history()}
</previous_iterations>

Consider the most recent synthesis and the areas identified for refinement:

<previous_synthesis>
{last_synthesis['synthesis']}
</previous_synthesis>

<refinement_areas>
{self._format_refinement_areas(last_synthesis['refinement_areas'])}
</refinement_areas>

Here's the original prompt you're addressing:

<original_prompt>
{original_prompt}
</original_prompt>

Instructions:
1. Analyze the original prompt, previous iterations, and refinement areas.
2. Provide an updated response that addresses the refinement areas while considering the full context.
3. Explain your reasoning thoroughly.
4. Include a confidence level (0-1) for your response.

Please structure your response as follows:

<problem_breakdown>
- Summarize key points from previous iterations and synthesis.
- Identify patterns or trends across iterations.
- List potential approaches to address each refinement area.
- Provide a detailed analysis of the problem, previous work, and refinement areas. Break down your thought process and consider different approaches.
</problem_breakdown>

<updated_response>
Provide your updated response, addressing the refinement areas and incorporating insights from your analysis. For each refinement area, explicitly state how it is addressed in your response.
</updated_response>

<reasoning>
Explain your reasoning for the updated response, referencing specific points from your analysis and how they informed your decisions.
</reasoning>

<confidence>
State your confidence level as a number between 0 and 1.
</confidence>

Remember to be thorough in your reasoning and consider all aspects of the problem before providing your final response.
