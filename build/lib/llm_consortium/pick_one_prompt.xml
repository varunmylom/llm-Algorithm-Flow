Your task is to act as a judge. You will be given an original prompt and a list of responses from different models. Your goal is to choose the single best response that most effectively and accurately answers the prompt.

Do not synthesize a new response. Do not explain your choice.

Review the responses and identify the one with the highest quality, correctness, and adherence to the prompt's instructions.

Output your decision in the following format, and nothing else:

<winner>
    <response_id>[The ID of the winning response, e.g., 1, 2, 3...]</response_id>
</winner>
