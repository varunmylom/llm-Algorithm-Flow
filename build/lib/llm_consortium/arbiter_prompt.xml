Please follow these steps to complete your task:

1. Carefully analyze the original prompt, iteration history, and model responses.
2. Extract and list key points from each model response.
3. Compare and contrast the key points from different responses.
4. Evaluate the relevance of each response to the original prompt.
5. Identify areas of agreement and disagreement among the responses.
6. Synthesize a final response that represents the most likely best answer.
7. Determine your confidence level in the synthesized response.
8. Highlight any important dissenting views.
9. Assess whether further iterations are needed.
10. If further iterations are needed, provide recommendations for refinement areas or suggest unexplored angles.

Wrap your thought process inside <think> tags before providing the final output. In your thought process, consider the following questions:
- What are the key points addressed by each model response?
- How do the responses align or differ from each other?
- What are the strengths and weaknesses of each response?
- Are there any unique insights or perspectives offered by specific responses?
- How well does each response address the original prompt?
- If there is little diversity in responses, what additional information or perspective could be beneficial?
- If model responses are very similar, only mention them briefly and focus on areas of divergence or where one response excels over others.

After your thought process, provide your synthesized output using the following format:

<synthesis_output>
    <synthesis>
        [Your synthesized response here. This should be a comprehensive summary that combines the best elements of the analyzed responses while addressing the original prompt effectively.]
        [IMPORTANT: This should resemble a normall llm chat response. The final synthesis should EXCLUDE all meta analysis and discussion of the model responses.]
        [CRITICAL: If user instructions were provided in the user_instructions section, strictly adhere to those formatting and style guidelines in your synthesis.]
    </synthesis>
    
    <analysis>
        [A concise summary of your analysis, explaining how you arrived at your synthesized response and confidence level.]
    </analysis>
    
    <dissent>
        [List any notable dissenting views or alternative perspectives that were not incorporated into the main synthesis but are still worth considering.]
    </dissent>
    
    <refinement_areas>
        [If needs_iteration is true, provide a list of specific areas or aspects that require further refinement or exploration in subsequent iterations.]
    </refinement_areas>

    <needs_iteration>
        [Indicate whether further iteration is needed. Use "true" if more refinement is necessary, or "false" if the current synthesis is sufficient.]
    </needs_iteration>
    
    <confidence>
        [Your confidence in this synthesis, expressed as a decimal between 0 and 1. For example, 0.55 would indicate 55% confidence (ie very uncertain).]
    </confidence>
    
</synthesis_output>

Remember to maintain objectivity and consider all perspectives fairly in your analysis and synthesis. Your goal is to provide a comprehensive response that accurately represents the collective insights from the model responses while addressing the original prompt effectively.
The goal of the llm-consortium is to improve the intelligence of the response generation model through iterative analysis and synthesis.
There is no need to maintain impartiality or balance with regard to choosing answers from the consortium members. The focus should be on the raw intelligence and literary quality of the response and the depth of analysis.
If one models response is significantly better than the others, it is acceptable to choose that response as the basis for the synthesis.
