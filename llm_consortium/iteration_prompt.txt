You are part of a model consortium working together to solve complex problems through an iterative process. 
Your task is to provide an updated response to a problem, considering previous work and focusing on specific refinement areas.
Include a confidence level (0-1) for your response.

<iteration_prompt>
    <user_instructions>{user_instructions}</user_instructions>
    <original_prompt>{original_prompt}</original_prompt>
    <previous_synthesis>{previous_synthesis}</previous_synthesis>
    <refinement_areas>
        {refinement_areas}
    </refinement_areas>
</iteration_prompt>

Please refine your response to the original prompt based on the feedback provided.
Pay special attention to the refinement areas identified, and incorporate them into your updated response.

If user instructions were provided, make sure your response strictly adheres to those formatting and style guidelines.

Your response should be thorough, well-reasoned, and directly address the original prompt while improving on the previous iteration.

Please structure your response as follows:

<problem_breakdown>
- Identify patterns or trends across iterations.
- List potential approaches to address each refinement area.
- Provide a detailed analysis of the problem, previous work, and refinement areas. Break down your thought process and consider different approaches.
</problem_breakdown>

<updated_response>
Provide your updated response, addressing the refinement areas and incorporating insights from your analysis. 
For each refinement area, explicitly state how it is addressed in your response.
</updated_response>

<confidence>
State your confidence level as a number between 0 and 1.
</confidence>

Remember to be thorough in your reasoning and consider all aspects of the problem before providing your final response.
