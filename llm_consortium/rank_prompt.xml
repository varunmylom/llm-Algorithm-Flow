Your task is to act as a judge. You will be given an original prompt and a list of responses from different models. Your goal is to rank all responses from best to worst based on quality, correctness, and adherence to the prompt's instructions.

Do not synthesize a new response. Do not explain your rankings.

Review the responses and order them from highest quality to lowest quality.

Output your decision in the following format, and nothing else:

<ranking>
    <rank position="1">[ID of best response]</rank>
    <rank position="2">[ID of second best response]</rank>
    <rank position="3">[ID of third best response]</rank>
    <!-- Continue for all responses -->
</ranking>
