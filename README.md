# LLM Consortium

## Inspiration

Based on Karpathy's observation:

"I find that recently I end up using all of the models and all the time. One aspect is the curiosity of who gets what, but the other is that for a lot of problems they have this "NP Complete" nature to them, where coming up with a solution is significantly harder than verifying a candidate solution. So your best performance will come from just asking all the models, and then getting them to come to a consensus."

A plugin for the `llm` package that implements a model consortium system with iterative refinement and response synthesis. This plugin orchestrates multiple learned language models to collaboratively solve complex problems through structured dialogue, evaluation and arbitration.

## Core Algorithm Flow

The following Mermaid diagram illustrates the core algorithm flow of the LLM Karpathy Consortium:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B[Get Model Responses]
    B --> C[Synthesize Responses]
    C --> D{Check Confidence}
    D -- Confidence >= Threshold --> E[Return Final Result]
    D -- Confidence < Threshold --> F{Max Iterations Reached?}
    F -- No --> G[Prepare Next Iteration]
    G --> B
    F -- Yes --> E
```

## Features

- **Multi-Model Orchestration**: Coordinate responses from multiple LLMs simultaneously
- **Iterative Refinement**: Automatically refine responses through multiple rounds until confidence threshold is met
- **Advanced Arbitration**: Uses a designated arbiter model to synthesize and evaluate responses
- **Database Logging**: Built-in SQLite logging of all interactions and responses
- **Configurable Parameters**: Adjustable confidence thresholds, iteration limits, and model selection
- **Hundreds of Models**: Supports all models available via llm plugins

## Installation
First, get https://github.com/simonw/llm

uv:
```bash
uv tool install llm
```
pipx:
```bash
pipx install llm
```

```bash
llm install llm-consortium
```

## Command Line Usage

Basic usage:
```bash
llm consortium "What are the key considerations for AGI safety?"
```

## This will

1. Send the prompt to multiple models in parallel.
2. Gather responses including reasoning and confidence.
3. Use an arbiter model to synthesize the responses and identify key points of agreement/disagreement
4. The arbiter model evaluates confidence
5. If confidence is below threshold and max iterations not reached:
   - Refinement areas are identified
   - A new iteration begins with an enhanced prompt
6. Process continues until confidence threshold is met or max iterations reached
  
### Options

- `-m, --models`: Models to include in consortium (can specify multiple)
- `--arbiter`: Model to use as arbiter (default: claude-3-opus-20240229)
- `--confidence-threshold`: Minimum confidence threshold (default: 0.8)
- `--max-iterations`: Maximum number of iteration rounds (default: 3)
- `--system`: Custom system prompt
- `--output`: Save full results to a JSON file


Advanced usage with options:
```bash
llm consortium "Your complex query" \
  --models claude-3-opus-20240229 \
  --models claude-3-sonnet-20240229 \
  --models gpt-4 \
  --models gemini-pro \
  --arbiter-model claude-3-opus-20240229 \
  --confidence-threshold 0.8 \
  --max-iterations 3 \
  --output results.json
```

### Response Structure

The plugin uses a structured XML format for responses:

```xml
<thought_process>
[Detailed reasoning about the problem]
</thought_process>

<answer>
[Final answer to the query]
</answer>

<confidence>
[Confidence level from 0 to 1]
</confidence>
```

### Database Logging

All interactions are automatically logged to a SQLite database located in the LLM user directory.

## Programmatic Usage

```python
from llm_consortium import ConsortiumOrchestrator

orchestrator = ConsortiumOrchestrator(
    models=["claude-3-opus-20240229", "gpt-4", "gemini-pro"],
    confidence_threshold=0.8,
    max_iterations=3,
    arbiter_model="claude-3-opus-20240229"
)

result = await orchestrator.orchestrate("Your prompt")

print(f"Synthesized Response: {result['synthesis']['synthesis']}")
print(f"Confidence: {result['synthesis']['confidence']}")
print(f"Analysis: {result['synthesis']['analysis']}")
```
