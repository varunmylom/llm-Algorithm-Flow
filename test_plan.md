# Test Plan for LLM Consortium

## Current Test Coverage
- Basic unit tests for `ConsortiumOrchestrator` class
- Tests for confidence parsing
- Tests for response synthesis
- Basic CLI tests

## Test Enhancement Plan

### 1. Unit Tests
- [ ] Add tests for `_read_system_prompt`, `_read_arbiter_prompt`, and `_read_iteration_prompt`
- [ ] Add tests for `parse_models` function
- [ ] Add tests for `_format_iteration_history` and `_format_responses`
- [ ] Add tests for `_construct_iteration_prompt`
- [ ] Add tests for `_extract_confidence`
- [ ] Add tests for `_parse_arbiter_response`
- [ ] Improve `test_get_model_response` to test error handling
- [ ] Add tests for edge cases and error conditions

### 2. CLI Tests
- [ ] Test each CLI option thoroughly
- [ ] Test with various model configurations
- [ ] Test with minimum and maximum iterations
- [ ] Test with custom system prompts
- [ ] Test output file generation
- [ ] Test stdin functionality
- [ ] Test raw output option
- [ ] Test save and remove command functionality

### 3. Integration Tests
- [ ] Test installation process with pip and other package managers
- [ ] Test integration with actual LLM models (mocked responses)
- [ ] Test database logging functionality
- [ ] Test performance with parallel model responses
- [ ] Test real-world use cases with common prompts

### 4. End-to-End Tests
- [ ] Test complete workflow from CLI input to final output
- [ ] Test consortium_id feature throughout the entire process
- [ ] Test against reference outputs for consistency

## Test Implementation Strategy
1. Start with enhancing unit tests to improve code coverage
2. Develop more comprehensive CLI tests
3. Implement integration tests with mocked model responses
4. Create end-to-end tests for complete functionality verification

## Tools and Resources
- pytest for test execution
- Coverage.py for measuring test coverage
- Mock for isolating tests from external dependencies
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD integration
