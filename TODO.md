# Tasks for llm-consortium project
1. [ ] Rank models by their contribution - apply regret to models that answer poorly.
2. [ ] Add aditional algorithms: 
   - best-of-n: simply pick the best answer from the consortium and return it without generating another
5. [ ] Make iterations cheaper by replying to the conversation_id and taking advantage of prompt caching when available
