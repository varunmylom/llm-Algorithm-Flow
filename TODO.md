need to track llm response IDs better and be able to output the llm response for response.id of the chosen answer. We also need to improve logging and tracking so that we can better evaluate model performance and arbiter decisions.

Interactively interview me using zenity, after you have researched the issue and the codebase of the relevant packages. The llm project is at /home/thomas/Projects/llm/my-llm and the docs are in /home/thomas/Projects/llm/my-llm/docs. 
the database is at /home/thomas/.config/io.datasette.llm/logs.db
