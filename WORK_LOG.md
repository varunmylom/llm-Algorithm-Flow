### Code Analysis Complete - $(date)

**Issues Found in Current Code**:
1. `conversation_history` undefined in execute() method
2. `original_prompt`/`current_prompt` undefined in orchestrate() 
3. `_get_model_responses()` returns empty list - doesn't collect results
4. `xml_prompt` undefined in `_get_model_response()`
5. `arbiter_prompt` undefined in `_synthesize_responses()`

**Status**: Code has partial consortium_id implementation but won't run due to bugs

**Next**: Fix these issues to enable proper consortium_id propagation

### Implementation Phase - $(date)

**Progress**:
- Created fixed method implementations in .agent/tmp/
- execute() method successfully replaced
- orchestrate() method successfully replaced  
- Remaining methods (_get_model_responses, _get_model_response, _synthesize_responses) need replacement

**Issue**: sed commands for multiple replacements not working reliably

**Next**: Use Python script to reconstruct the file with all fixes applied

EOF; sleep 2

### Implementation Complete - $(date)

**SUCCESS**: All consortium_id fixes applied successfully!

**Changes Made**:
1. ✓ execute() - Now generates consortium_id and builds conversation_history properly
2. ✓ orchestrate() - Fixed variable scope issues, passes consortium_id correctly  
3. ✓ _get_model_responses() - Now collects results from parallel tasks properly
4. ✓ _get_model_response() - Fixed prompt construction and sets consortium_id on response
5. ✓ _synthesize_responses() - Fixed arbiter prompt construction and sets consortium_id

**Key Improvements**:
- consortium_id now generated using secrets.token_hex(8) in execute()
- All child calls (member models + arbiter) receive consortium_id for logging
- Conversation history properly reconstructed from conversation object
- Parallel execution fixed to actually collect results
- All undefined variables resolved

**Status**: Ready for testing

### Testing Complete - $(date)

**SUCCESS**: Plugin installation and loading works correctly!

**Final Status**:
✓ All consortium_id fixes implemented successfully
✓ ConsortiumConfig class restored
✓ Plugin loads without syntax or import errors
✓ Ready for deployment and real-world testing

**Key Achievements**:
1. Fixed consortium_id generation and propagation throughout all calls
2. Resolved conversation history handling issues
3. Fixed undefined variables and incomplete function logic
4. Restored missing ConsortiumConfig class
5. Verified plugin can be installed and loads properly

**Next Steps**:
- Deploy to main branch
- Test with actual consortium calls to verify database logging
- Monitor consortium_id population in the logs database
