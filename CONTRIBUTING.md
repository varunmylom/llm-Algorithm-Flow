# Contributing to LLM Consortium

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the LLM Consortium project! This guide will help you get started with development and understand how to contribute effectively.

## Project Overview

LLM Consortium is a plugin for the `llm` package that implements a model consortium system with iterative refinement and response synthesis. It orchestrates multiple language models to collaboratively solve complex problems through structured dialogue, evaluation, and arbitration.

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd llm-consortium
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```
